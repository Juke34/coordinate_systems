In addition to representing a wide variety of sequence changes from single residue variation through large cytogenetic events, HGVS attempts to also encode in strings notions of biological mechanism (e.g., inversion as a kind of deletion-insertion event), predicted events (e.g., parentheses for computing protein sequence), and complex states (e.g., mosaicism). In practice, HGVS recommendations are difficult to implement fully and consistently, leading to ambiguity in presentation. In contrast, the VRS is a formal specification that improves consistency of representation among computer systems. VRS is currently less expressive than HGVS for rarer cases of variation, such as cytogenetic variation or context-based allele representations (e.g., insT written as dupT when the insertion follows a T). Future versions of the specification will seek to address limitations while preserving principles of conceptual clarity and precision.</p> <ul> <li>HGVS is a nomenclature. HGVS is designed primarily for human-readability not computational identification. HGVS is not applied consistently in reporting, literature, and databases even though there has been great strides to provide tooling to validate HGVS syntax. HGVS does not normalize variation using VOCA. Several HGVS expressions can represent the same variant. VRS is not designed to be human-readable (we have started designing implementation guidance for wrapping VRS representations in Value Object Descriptors to allow exchange systems to add human-readable and useful attributes that improve the productivity of data exchange contracts involving variation - see VRSATILE).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"variants/#vcf","title":"VCF","text":"<p>The Variant Call Format (VCF) is the de facto standard for representing alleles, particularly for use during primary analysis in high-throughput sequencing pipelines. VCF permits a wide range of annotations on alleles, such as quality and likelihood scores. VCF is a file-based format and is exclusively for genomic alleles. In contrast, the VRS data model abstractly represents Alleles, Haplotypes, and Genotypes on all sequence types, is independent of medium, and is well-suited to secondary analyses, allele interpretation, aggregation, and system-level interoperability.</p> <ul> <li>VCF is genomic only. VCF is a file format. VCF is primarily designed for high-volume, compact variant calls. VCF is not designed to be extensible in the same way as VRS to support much broader representations of variation independent of samples or cohorts.

The Variation Services return the minimum deleted sequence required to avoid over precision. For example, a deletion of one G in a run of 4 is specified with deleted and inserted sequences of GGGG and GGG respectively, avoiding the need to left or right shift the minimal representation.
